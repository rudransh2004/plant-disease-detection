PLANT DISEASE DETECTION USING KERAS AND TENSORFLOW - CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK


IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE MADE TWO DEEP LEARNING MODEL

1-) WE HAVE APPLIED TRANSFER LEARNING IN VGG16 MODEL TO GET GOOD ACCURACY AND WE GOT AN ACCURACY OF 91%

2-)WE HAVE MADE OUR OWN NEURAL NETWORK MODEL IN KERAS AND TENSORFLOW AND WE GOT AN ACCURACY OF 96%


FILE FOR VGG16 MODEL TRAINING IS vgg16 trained model
FILE FOR  VGG16 MODEL PREDICTION IS vgg16 prediction model


FILE FOR TRAINING OUR OWN NEURAL NETWORK IS keras training
FILE FOR PREDICTION IN OUR OWN NEURAL NETWORK IS loaded model in keras
